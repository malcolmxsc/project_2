# <Fitness Tracker>
The Fitness Tracker is a simple web application that allows the user to Log daily entries of their physical activity. The application currently supports 4 exercise types that the user can chose from depending on the type of exercise completed. The user also has the ability to input their age and BMI statistics under the Body tab, this tab will display the users most recent Body update.

# Next Steps

The next step would be to sort the exercises by their excercise type and only display exercises from that specific category.
Another feature would be to show the users weight progess on the body tab, the most recent display would take the difference between the last 7 updates and calculate the users weekly weight gain or loss.
